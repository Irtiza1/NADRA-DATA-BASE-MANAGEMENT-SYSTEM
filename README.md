# NADRA-DATA-BASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
## Overview
The Nadra database management system is the subject of a C language project I created. The purpose of developing this project is to manage the user's data and run-time information and to securely record that data. The following are the project's primary components:

## Features:
1-Filing: This is how data is handled.
2-Searching is used to retrieve any person's information from the records.
3-Structure: This is used to arrange the data in a particular way for storage. 
4- Functions: This project has a number of features that help to make it effective. 
5- Identity Number: To identify amongst users, we are giving each one of them a special identification number, which is one of the project's distinguishing characteristics.
